 <h1>Anime </h1 >
    <p  style="color: rgb(64, 146, 194);">The word anime is a shortened form of the Japanese word animeshon,which means animation.
        When i am watching anime i feel light and joyful.But depending on the plot of the anime my feelings change.
        Like sometimes i feel motivated,sometimes i can't even define/express my feelings.Most emotional moment while watching anime was in Naruto,when Sasuke and Itache fought their last battle.
        Pokemon,Demon slayer,Spirited away,Ghost in the shell and Perfect blue etc.
